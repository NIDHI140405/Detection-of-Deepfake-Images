Overview
Deepfake images, created using AI techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can be challenging to distinguish from genuine images. This project aims to build a robust system capable of detecting deepfake images by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Features
Data collection and preprocessing
Feature extraction using advanced techniques
Training deep learning models for detection
Evaluation and validation of model performance
Deployment on Google Colab for ease of access and use
